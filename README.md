Customer Churn Prediction 
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Machine Learning. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify factors leading to churn, helping businesses take proactive actions to retain customers.

Objective
Analyze customer data to identify churn patterns.
Build a predictive model using Machine Learning algorithms.
Evaluate model performance and optimize for accuracy.
🛠 Technologies Used
Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment (if applicable): Flask / Streamlit
Dataset
Used a customer behavior dataset containing demographic details, service usage, and churn status.
Steps Involved
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature encoding)
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning for optimization
5️⃣ Deployment (if applicable)
